Have your ever seen a fish that would have lasted long in one place? Probably no, unless it was a dead one. Thus, common Pisces must be always in move.

If Pisces could not swim on the high seas, they will anchor on some colorful coral reef. Moreover, the Latin proverb says "Water will become putrid if kept stagnant" and that Pisces understand very well.

Power and money don't attract Pisces much. Having the power brings responsibilities, worries and often also the need to be chained to one place.

Pisces are spiritually and emotionally based beings governed by intuition. One must act quickly in the underwater world and there is often no time for long analysis and prudent judging.

Pisces perceive money as a mean to a comfortable life and not as its goal. Pisces are aware of passing value of money more than other Sun signs are.

Pisces have the possibility to be comfortably carried with the flow and only few swim against. Pisces naturally choose rather the path of least resistance.

Pisces are dreamers, so they often just put on rose-colored glasses and they see the world in a more pleasant way. The real fish can live only under water and does not know our world.

The Pisces Men are sensitive and perceptive. Usually they like to help others. You will certainly not be bored with such a man. So if he will not swim for another.

The Pisces Woman falls in love with the dreams and ideals of her partner to share them with him.

Pisces are rarely chained to the corner. The world is an endless ocean for them.
