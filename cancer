Cancers often submit to changes of their various feelings. And their feelings change as often as the lunar phase. Actually the Moon is a planet of Cancer and their element is watter, which is a symbol of the unconscious.

Because people born in Cancer are really sensitive, others like to share secrets with them.

Thanks to their conservative nature Cancers don't prefer changes and adventures. Sometimes they can miss interesting and lucrative opportunities because they are not able quickly go forward.

Cancers can be easily hurt with your inappropriate remarks. When that happens, they will withdraw to solitude. Rarely will Cancer strike back in revenge.

It is not easy to convince Cancers to give up something, what they really like. If Cancers are clutching something in their claws, they will not easily let it go.

Before people born in Cancer launch into something new, they carefully plan. Each Cancer enjoys the support either in the experiences or in good examples.

Cancers have never enough money and material goods. Even while traveling, it is always very important for them to have a save place to return.

The Cancer man needs love. It is a caretaker and nearness of someone beloved means a lot to him.

The Cancer woman is moody. You have to know how to comfort her in the moments when she doubts whether she is really beautiful, whether she can cook well or whether you honestly love her.

Cancers avoid the stormy waters and hate waste of resources. Extravagant hedonists will not usually be among their good friends.
