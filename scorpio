Get on with Scorpios is not easy. Insults bounce from them and they will not melt down by compliments like the snow in spring. Scorpios don't need anybody to tell them how good they are.

Scorpios often have the evil eye. If your eyes meet, you will probably move first.

Scorpios are very emotional and they take everything seriously. They mask the inner volcano with their outer balance.

Scorpios never forget, how others treat them. Even if they forgive you, they will still keep old grievances in memory.

Scorpios are loyal friends in a case of emergency. They are able to sacrifice many for others.

Scorpios do not like to go with the flow and are more loners. They go out, but they are not too much interested in what others think about them.

Scorpios don't believe the false values and as parents Scorpios will not build castles in the air for their children.

If you are a woman and the word passion raise fears in you, then you should rather forget on a Scorpio man.

Women born in Scorpio are proud and mysterious. The saying goes "you can't see inside the watermelon nor the woman's mind" and that is doubly true in the case of Scorpio woman!
Never ask Scorpios what they think, if you are not ready to hear the truth.
