Aquarius are often the great visionaries and dreamers who don't respect much traditional values and knowledge of the past.

Famous Aquarius are for example Charles Darwin, Thomas Alva Edison and Galileo Galilei. Each of them made enough to turn science over.

Aquarius will not judge you according to the first impression. They will be frank with you, but they will not tell you how you should live. Aquarius know that everyone has own ideals and desires.

Aquarius live in the sky (their element is the air), so you can see them sitting on a rainbow and pouring currents of their imagination on the ground.

Aquarius don't like to make any commitments, so they feel uncomfortable when they has to tell a fixed term for appointment or project delivery. Aquarius leave things rather open and wants to have a back door.

Aquarius is not the one who goes first into battle with a flag. Instead of real warfare he will prefer to meditate under a tree and wait for enlightenment as the Buddha.

The Aquarius man is attracted by mystery. The woman who wants to get him has therefore arouse his curiosity first. Thus, reading an open book is no challenge for the Aquarius man.

The Aquarius man don't like purposeless gestures. Instead of a bouquet of roses he will give you a single dandelion with a smile.

The Aquarius woman expects that you will be interesting and entertaining. She lives for the present. Be bored with some old millionaire and wait to kick the bucket, it's really not her style.

Aquarius unfortunately often suffer from a lack of permanent feelings. It is characteristic for them, because Aquarius element is the air. Even if they can really get excited deeply for things, it often don't last long.
