Instability and variability is essential characteristic of Gemini, because their element is the air and they are under the influence of planet Mercury (Mercury is also flying god).

In most typical cases you can perceive a certain nervous energy that surrounds Gemini. The clearest example is Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean. Inattention, eloquence and restlessness brilliantly played by Johnny Depp are not strange to him. The secret is that he is a genuine Gemini.

Gemini can seamlessly change everything from hair style, dress, ideas to work or partner.

 Adjusting to a significant life change is much easier for them than for the other signs.

Thanks to the communication talent Gemini easily prove successful in advertising, media, public relations or even in politics. The worse they tolerate stereotype, the more they can be friendly, funny and eager for novelties.

Gemini will be your humorous friend, who will have no problem doing at least two things at once.
Gemini don't gather assets. They would feel be bound up. Gemini likes to replace old things with new ones, although they may regret such experiments later.

Gemini are active and cheerful, but unpredictable. And therefore a bit mysterious too.

Instead of telling you frankly “I love you”, Gemini will keep their feelings secret.

Typical Gemini don't hold on old friends, places and memories. They don't judge others strictly.

People born under this sign of Gemini don't want to live a dull and monotone life. They will not go by train when they can fly a plane.
